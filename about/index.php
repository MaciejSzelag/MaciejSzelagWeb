                            touch, and
                            a solid dose of life experience. I design and build fast, modern, and user-focused websites
                            and web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Laravel. I value clean
                            code, usability, and results – no unnecessary noise, just meaningful work.

                            website or a complex application, I believe every project deserves attention, clarity, and
